Demonstration on how to migrate a an existing GXT application to Vaadin with minimal 
required steps. Existing functionality continues working as is, and the new
functionality should be developed using Vaadin Framework's server-side approach.
This sample project gives some guidance, but every migration project should be 
considered case-by-case.
